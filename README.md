# Applications-to-Genomics-and-Beyond
using the implementation of dynamic programming algorithms for determining both global and local alignments of pairs of sequences. In this Application, I will demonstrate the utility of these algorithms in two domains. In the first part of the Application, examining an interesting problem from genomics. (This is based on "Introduction to Computational Genomics", by Nello Cristianini and Matthew W. Hahn). Then I compare two sequences that have diverged from a common ancestor sequence due to mutation. (Mutation here includes base-pair substitution, which changes the sequence content, and insertion/deletion, which change the sequence lengths.) In the second part of the Application, considering words that have spelling mistakes.
